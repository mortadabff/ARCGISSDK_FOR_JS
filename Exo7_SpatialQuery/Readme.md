The difference between filters (`definitionExpression`) and SQL queries (`queryFeatureLayer`) in the context of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript may seem subtle because both use SQL expressions to manipulate data. However, they serve distinct purposes and operate slightly differently.

### Filters (definitionExpression)
- **Usage**: Filters, defined via `definitionExpression`, are used directly on map layers to limit the data displayed to the user. They do not retrieve or modify the data itself; they simply filter which data are visible on the map based on the provided SQL expression.
- **Performance**: Filters are generally applied directly by the server (in the case of a hosted service) or by the client (if the data is already loaded), which can enhance performance by only processing the necessary data for display.
- **Context**: Ideal for use cases where you want to hide or show certain entities without altering the underlying data structure or performing more complex analyses.

### SQL Queries (queryFeatureLayer)
- **Usage**: Queries, such as those performed by `queryFeatureLayer`, are more complex operations that interrogate the data layer to retrieve, filter, and potentially manipulate data that can then be used for calculations, analyses, or specific displays.
- **Data Return**: These queries can return data sets that are not necessarily directly displayed to the user but can be used to feed other processes or analyses in the application.
- **Context**: Ideal for extracting data sets for reports, detailed analyses, or dynamic interactions where the retrieved data influences other parts of the application.

### Comparison
- **Filters (`definitionExpression`)**: Modify the visibility of data on the map based on a condition. No data is retrieved or returned; it is simply a visual filtering operation.
- **Queries (`queryFeatureLayer`)**: Retrieve data that meets a specific condition, allowing for richer interaction or further analysis. Can be used to generate complex displays or fuel application logic.

In summary, although both filters and queries use SQL expressions, their use in a GIS application can vary greatly depending on the specific needs of visual filtering or data manipulation and analysis.
